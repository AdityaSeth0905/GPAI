General Purpose AI for CIIE.

Currently I have added a speech recognition function that stores new words in new_words.json file and whenever it hears a certain words that exist in both new_words.py and responses.py
It returns the value from responses.json .
It also stores the Frequency of the  words added in the dictionary.
And can generate a Words Frequency bar chart using MatPLotLib.matplot package.
I faced so many challenges to make the chart appear and it finally did.

The Problems I am facing are:
  1. Sometimes it doesn't record new words for no reason at all.
  2. Sometimes it does record new words but doesn't give response related to it.
  3. Code seems to be correct but idk why it's not working. I took help from ChatGPT and Google Bard but none of them could solve my problem.
